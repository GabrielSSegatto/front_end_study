# 🖥️ Front-End Study Path

This repository contains exercises, snippets, and practice projects that I am creating while learning front-end development.  
The goal is to track my learning progress and organize small experiments in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related technologies.

### 📌 Contents
- HTML & CSS exercises
- JavaScript snippets and small projects
- Frameworks/Libraries practice (React, Tailwind, etc.)
- Notes and mini challenges

### 🚀 Note
This repository is meant to track my personal learning path in front-end development.  
When I create more advanced or complete projects, they will be saved in **separate repositories** dedicated to each project.

💡 This is a record of my growth as a front-end developer and a reference for future projects.
